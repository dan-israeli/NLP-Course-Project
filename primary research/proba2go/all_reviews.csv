As a couple, we always prefer a double bed rather than two singles pushed together! However, we did not request this during our booking so there is a good chance that they would honour this request should we have made it. Also, in our room the shower head seemed to be in the wrong place & soaked the floor. Neither was a massive problem for us & didn't dampen our enjoyment of the weekend break we had.",7.5
