## Running Instructions

### Primary Research - Creating the proba2go Files 
To recreate the proba2go files:

- positive_proba2go.txt
- negative_proba2go.txt
- baseline_proba2go.txt
  
Please refer to the provided "LLM_proba2go.py" Python file (in the primary research/proba2go folder).

First, please add the file "all_reviews.csv" to the directory where the Python file is placed (on your local machine).
The file is provided in the primary research/proba2go folder.

Then, please enter your OpenAI API key in the designated line at the top of the Python file:
